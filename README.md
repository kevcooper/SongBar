# SongBar 2
____________________

This is the first major update to Songbar.
This version removed the Sparkle framework in favor of exclusive MAS distribution,
This should make building on your side easier as this removes the need for any 3rd party CocoaPods and allows you to build directly from the included Xcode project.
